In the example provided we will use previously learned parameters to identify handwritten

The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System is just that type of data set. Spend just a few minutes browsing the data and you will see that it is rife with errors. For example, consider the drug metformin. In the current database I am working on there are 84,459 different mentions of metformin. By grouping and counting these mentions we can see the top 10 most frequent representations in the table below. More than half of all mentions of metformin are represented as METFORMIN HCL whereas about 24% of the mentions are represented simply as METFORMIN.</p>
