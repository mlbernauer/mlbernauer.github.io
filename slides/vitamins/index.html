# Vitamins

(Usha Sethuraman)
</script>
</section>


<section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin A
* Derived from pigments in nature called carotenoids
* Water insoluble
* Destroyed by heat, light, oxidation, and dehydration
* Esterified to to retinyl esters by intestinal cells and stored in liver
* Hydrolized by liver to form retinol; essential for functional integrity of epithelial cells and vision
* Vitamin A deficiency is leading cause of preventable blindness in children
* Deficiency increases risk of severe infection
* Deficiency may occur due to inadequate absorption (celiac disease), hepatic disease, low-fat/protein diets
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Clinical Manifestations of deficiency
* Extensor surface of become dry and scaly (follicular hyperkeratosis)
* Keratinization of conjunctiva and lacrimal glands &rarr; dryness of eyes
* Bitot spots: patches that appear on conjunctiva due to keratinization
* Night blindess results from delay in rhodopsin synthesis
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Treatment and Prevention
* Breastfeeding is protective against vitamin A deficiency
* Encouraging vitamin A-rich diets, vitamin A supplementation, and food fortification
can prvent and treat this deficiency
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
5-year old boy, adopted from India, bumps into objects frequently, particularly in evenings. Height and weight
are below the 5th percentile. Silver-colored patches in his conjunctiva.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
* Adopted from developing country where deficiencies are common
* History of bumping into objects in evening consisent with night blindness (nyctalopia)
* Presence of Bitot spots on conjuctiva confirms diagnosis
* Treat with vitamin A; symptomes should improve
* Delay in treatment may lead to blindness
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
A 3-year-old girl brought to ED for irritability. Denies fever, URI, trauma. Progessively irritable over
past few days. Complaints of headache, nausea but no emesis. Headache persists despite tylenol. Reports
taking brothers pills QID to get healthier.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
Drowsiness, painful joints, loss of hair, increased intracranial pressure, and carotenemia are all presenting
symptoms of excessive ingestion of vitamin A.
</script>
</section>
</section>


<section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin D
* Ergosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol are converted to ergocalciferol (D<sub>2</sub>) and cholecalciferol (D<sub>3</sub>)
in the skin upon exposure to UV light
* D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> are absorbed readily from the small intestine
* D<sub>3</sub> is hydroxylated to 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> via 25-hydroxylase and further converted to 1,25-dihydroxy-D<sub>3</sub>
 in the kidneys by 1-hydroxylase
* 1,25-dihydroxy-D<sub>3</sub> is the active form that regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub> metabolism
* Vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorus
* Deficiency is characterized by defect in mineralization
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Rickets
* Can occur in breastfed infants who:
    * Are not supplemented with vitamin D
    * Have inadequate sun exposure
    * Inadequate penetration of sunlight due to dark-skin
    * Are rapidly growing
* Congenital rickets can occure when maternal intake of vitamin D is low
* Celiac disease, steatorrhea, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, steroids, anticonvulsants
can predispose individuals to vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption from the gut
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Clinical manifestation of deficiency
* Seizures and tetany due to hypocalcemia
* Hypotonia, failure to thrive
* Delayed milestones, potbelly, bowlegs, kyphosis, pelvic deformities, delayed dentition, widened wrists
* Osteomalacia
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Diagnosis
* Nutritional rickets should be distinguished from vitamin D-resistant rickets (familial hypophosphatemia) due
to defect in phosphate reabsorption and conversion of 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> to 1,25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>
* Vitamin D-dependent rickets is due to reduced activity of 1-&alpha; hydroxylase.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Treatment and prevention
* All infants should receive a minimum of 200 IU of vitamin D daily during first 2 postnatal months
* Alternatively, 15,000 mcg of vitamin D can be given in a single day (avoid ethylene glycol toxicity)
* Nutritional rickets should repsond with incrased PO<sub>4</sub> in 4 days and radiologic evidnece of healing after 1-2 weeks
* Once healed, reduce dose to 10 mcg/d
* Vitamin D-resistant rickets must be treated with oral phosphates and high doses of 1,25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Excess vitamin D
* Hypotonia, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, hypertension and corneal clouding may result from excess
vitamin D
* Radiographs may show internal calcifications (kidney stones)
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
A 2-yo African-American boy, exclusively breastfed until 1 year of age, poor feeder since then. Legs are 
slightly bowed and has frontal bossing, no teeth and has not yet started walking. Labs include decreased
phosphorus, decreased calcium, elevated alkaline phosphatase. Wrist show osteopenia. Diagnosed with
nutritional rickets.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
* Risk factors include race, preterm birth, exclusive breastfeeindg with no supplementation until 1 year of age
* Recognition of risk factors and early supplementation can prevent rickets
* Treatment includes correction of calcium and phosphorus levels
    * Administration of 50-150 mcg of D<sub>3</sub> x 2-3 months followed by 400 IU/d maintenance dose
    * Monitor calicum, phosphorus and radiographs for healing
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
A 8-mo Caucasian boy with complains of cough, runny nose, wheezing for past 3 days. Fussy with some redness in eyes.
He is breastfed exculsively. History of bronchitis in past. Weights 4.1 kg with HR of 160 bpm, RR of 80 breaths per min.
Slightly depressed deep tendon reflexes.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
* Episodes of wheezing with failure to thrive and features of rickets
* Sweat test revealed cystic fibrosis
* Cystic fibrosis lease to malabsorption and deficiencies in fat soluble vitamins
* History of bronchiolitis and failure to thrive should raise suspicion for cystic fibrosis and
vitamin deficiencies
</script>

## Vitamin E
* Includes a group of compounds called tocopherols that have antioxidant properties which are facilitated by the
presence of ascorbic acid
* Found in green plants, lettuce, vegetable oils, milk, and eggs.
* Helps prevent atherosclerosis by inhibiting oxidation of LDL
* Appears to inhibit platelet activity
* Deficiencies result from malabsorption, abetalipoproteinemia, short bowel syndrome, cholestatic liver disease and low-birthweight
* Deficiencie cause muslce weakness, double vision, hemolytic anemia, reduced reflexes, and constricted visual fields
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Treatmetn and prevention
* Treat deficiencies with inclusion of 0.7 mg/g of unsaturated fat
* Supplements (tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate) are necessary in children with malabsorption
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Excess vitamin E
* Excess vitamin E may result in nausea, diarrhea, and vitamin K antagonism (hypocoagulability)
</script>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin K
* Obtained from diet or intestinal bacteria
* Essential for synthesizing prothrombin, clotting factors II, VII, IX, X
* Newborns are often deficient because insufficient intestinal flora
* Hemorrhage more common in breastfed infants because human milk contains low amounts of vitamin K
* Chronic oral antibiotics, biliary obstruction, chronic diarrhea, cystic fibrosis, sprue, and hepatic
damage can cause deficiency due to malabsorption
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Treatment and Prevention
* All newborns should receive 1 mg of vitamin K to prevent early vitamin K deficiency and parenteral vitamin K to prevent
late vitamin K deficiency
