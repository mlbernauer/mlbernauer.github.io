# Vitamins

(_Usha Sethuraman_)
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin A
* Derived from pigments in nature called carotenoids
* Water insoluble
* Destroyed by heat, light, oxidation, and dehydration
* Esterified to to retinyl esters by intestinal cells and stored in liver
* Hydrolized by liver to form retinol; essential for functional integrity of epithelial cells and vision
* Vitamin A deficiency is leading cause of preventable blindness in children
* Deficiency increases risk of severe infection. May occur due to inadequate absorption (celiac disease), hepatic disease, low-fat/protein diets
* The current RDI is 1500 &mu;g/L (5000 IU)
* Toxicity results in hepatotoxicity, visual changes, craniofacial anomalies in fetuses, and increase fractures
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Clinical Manifestations of deficiency
* Extensor surface of become dry and scaly (follicular hyperkeratosis)
* Keratinization of conjunctiva and lacrimal glands &rarr; dryness of eyes
* Bitot spots: patches that appear on conjunctiva due to keratinization
* Night blindess results from delay in rhodopsin synthesis
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Treatment and Prevention
* Breastfeeding is protective against vitamin A deficiency
* Encouraging vitamin A-rich diets, vitamin A supplementation, and food fortification
can prevent and treat this deficiency
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
5-year old boy, adopted from India, bumps into objects frequently, particularly in evenings. Height and weight
are below the 5th percentile. Silver-colored patches in his conjunctiva.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
* Adopted from developing country where deficiencies are common
* History of bumping into objects in evening consistent with night blindness (nyctalopia)
* Presence of Bitot spots on conjunctiva confirms diagnosis
* Treat with vitamin A; symptoms should improve
* Delay in treatment may lead to blindness
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
A 3-year-old girl brought to ED for irritability. Denies fever, URI, trauma. Progressively irritable over
past few days. Complaints of headache, nausea but no emesis. Headache persists despite Tylenol. Reports
taking brothers pills QID to get healthier.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
Drowsiness, painful joints, loss of hair, increased intracranial pressure, and carotenemia are all presenting
symptoms of excessive ingestion of vitamin A.
</script>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin D
* Ergosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol are converted to ergocalciferol (D<sub>2</sub>) and cholecalciferol (D<sub>3</sub>)
in the skin upon exposure to UV light
* D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> are absorbed readily from the small intestine
* D<sub>3</sub> is hydroxylated to 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> via 25-hydroxylase and further converted to 1,25-dihydroxy-D<sub>3</sub>
 in the kidneys by 1-hydroxylase
* 1,25-dihydroxy-D<sub>3</sub> is the active form that regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub> metabolism
* Vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorus
* Deficiency is characterized by defect in mineralization
* RDI is 0.01 mg (400 IU)
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Rickets
* Can occur in breastfed infants who:
    * Are not supplemented with vitamin D
    * Have inadequate sun exposure
    * Inadequate penetration of sunlight due to dark-skin
    * Are rapidly growing
* Congenital rickets can occur when maternal intake of vitamin D is low
* Celiac disease, steatorrhea, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, steroids, anticonvulsants
can predispose individuals to vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption from the gut
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Clinical manifestation of deficiency
* Seizures and tetany due to hypocalcemia
* Hypotonia, failure to thrive
* Delayed milestones, potbelly, bowlegs, kyphosis, pelvic deformities, delayed dentition, widened wrists
* Osteomalacia
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Diagnosis
* Nutritional rickets should be distinguished from vitamin D-resistant rickets (familial hypophosphatemia) due
to defect in phosphate reabsorption and conversion of 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> to 1,25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>
* Vitamin D-dependent rickets is due to reduced activity of 1-&alpha; hydroxylase.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Treatment and prevention
* All infants should receive a minimum of 200 IU of vitamin D daily during first 2 postnatal months
* Alternatively, 15,000 mcg of vitamin D can be given in a single day (avoid ethylene glycol toxicity)
* Nutritional rickets should respond with increased PO<sub>4</sub> in 4 days and radiologic evidence of healing after 1-2 weeks
* Once healed, reduce dose to 10 mcg/d
* Vitamin D-resistant rickets must be treated with oral phosphates and high doses of 1,25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Excess vitamin D
* Hypotonia, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, hypertension and corneal clouding may result from excess
vitamin D
* Radiographs may show internal calcifications (kidney stones)
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1

slightly bowed and has frontal bossing, no teeth and has not yet started walking. Labs include decreased
phosphorus, decreased calcium, elevated alkaline phosphatase. Wrist show osteopenia. Diagnosed with
nutritional rickets.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 1
* Risk factors include race, preterm birth, exclusive breastfeeding with no supplementation until 1 year of age
* Recognition of risk factors and early supplementation can prevent rickets
* Treatment includes correction of calcium and phosphorus levels
    * Administration of 50-150 mcg of D<sub>3</sub> x 2-3 months followed by 400 IU/d maintenance dose
    * Monitor calcium, phosphorus and radiographs for healing
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2

Slightly depressed deep tendon reflexes.
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Case 2
* Episodes of wheezing with failure to thrive and features of rickets
* Sweat test revealed cystic fibrosis
* Cystic fibrosis lease to malabsorption and deficiencies in fat soluble vitamins
* History of bronchiolitis and failure to thrive should raise suspicion for cystic fibrosis and
vitamin deficiencies
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin E

</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin K
* Obtained from diet or intestinal bacteria
* Essential for synthesizing prothrombin, clotting factors II, VII, IX, X
* Newborns are often deficient because insufficient intestinal flora
* Hemorrhage more common in breastfed infants because human milk contains low amounts of vitamin K
* Chronic oral antibiotics, biliary obstruction, chronic diarrhea, cystic fibrosis, sprue, and hepatic damage can cause deficiency due to malabsorption
* RDI is 80 &mu;g/L
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>

# The Role of Vitamins in Chronic Disease Prevention

(_Fairfield et al._)
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Folate, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>
### Coronary Heart Disease
  * Elevated homocysteine can result in 2-fold increase in CHD
  * Folate has been shown to lower homocysteine by 25%
  * B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> associated with less reduction in homocysteine compared to folate
  * Low folate associated with higher risk of CHD in Canadian cohort
  * High B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> reduced risk of CHD
  * Recommend multivitamin for most adults (400 &mu;g folate, 2 &mu;g of B<sub>6</sub> and 9 &mu;g of B</sub>12</sub> for most adults
  * Test for hyperhomocysteinemia or recommend folate 800 &mu;g/d in patients with premature CHD or family Hx of premature CHD
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Folate, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>
### Colorectal Caner
* Folate from multivitamin use > 10 yrs resulted in 25% reduction in colon cancer risk<small><sup>7</sup></small>
* 15 yrs multivitamin use with folate had 75% reduction in colorectal cancer risk<small><sup>8</sup></small>
* MTHFR polymorphisms associated with increase colorectal cancer risk

### Breast cancer
* High folate intake may reduce breast cancer risk
* Folate corresponded to 25% reduction in breast cancer among alcohol users<small><sup>10</sup></small>
* Higher folate requirements with MTHFR polymorphism
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Folate, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>
### Neural Tube Defects
* Folate is necessary for embryogenesis; supplementation reduces risk of neural tube defects
* Doses above current RDI are required to maximally reduce risk of neural tube defects
* Recommend supplementing all women who might become pregnant with folate 800 &mu;g/d to prevent birth defects
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin E
### Coronary Heart Disease
* Vitamin E is thought to play a role in CHD prevention by reducing oxidative damage to lipid membranes and LDL and reducing platelet adhesion
* Observational studies state 44% reduction in major coronary disease in women taking more 67mg/d<small><sup>16</sup></small>
* Clinical trials have not established link

### Prostate cancer
* Not a strong link between Vitamin E consumption and breast, lung, and colon cancer
* Evidence suggests &alpha;-tocopherol may decrease prostate cancer risk among smokers<small><sup>25</sup></small>
* Mixed evidence from studies looking serum Vitamin E levels with reductions in prostate cancer risk
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Carotenoids
### Lung Cancer
* Observational studies strongly support inverse relationship between carotenoids and lung cancer
* Reports 32% reduction in risk of lung cancer for people consuming diet high in carotenoids<small><sup>24</sup></small>
* Two RPCT showed statistically significant increase in lung cancer among smoking men receiving supplements (confined to heaviest smokers)
* Strong evidence suggesting beta carotene supplementation increases risk of lung cancer among smokers
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Carotenoids
### Colorectal cancer
* Among EtOH users, beta carotene supplements decreased colon cancer<small><sup>25,28</sup></small>
* Beta carotene supplementation does not appear to decrease colorectal cancer risk in non EtOH users
* Regular users of alcohol may benefit from beta carotene supplements (little evidence)

### Prostate cancer
* 32% reduction in prostate cancer among non-EtOH users on beta carotene supplementation<small><sup>25</sup></small>
* Some evidence suggests increased risk of prostate cancer with beta carotene and EtOH use<small><sup>25</sup></small>
* 32$ reduction in prostate cancer among individuals with low baseline serum beta carotene levels<small><sup>85</sup></small>
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Carotenoids
### Breast cancer
* Majority of observational studies did not show reduced breast cancer risk with increased beta carotene consumption<small><sup>87</sup></small>
* One cohort study found that premenopausal women with family history had significant reductions in breast cancer risk with increased alpha and beta carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, and total vitamin A intake.<small><sup>92</sup></small>

### Coronary Heart Disease
* Antioxidant properties of carotenoids thought to play role in CHD reduction
* Case control study results have been mixed
* Beta carotene was not found to reduce CHD risk in primary prevention studies<small><sup>25,28-31</sup></small>
* Two studies suggested increased mortality among smokers taking beta carotene supplements<small><sup>18,19</sup></small>
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin D
* Deficiency is associated with rickets in children and secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fracture in adults
* Excessive intake (>0.05 mg [2000 IU]) can cause soft tissue calcification and hypercalcemia
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin D
### Bone Fracture
* Supplementation decreases bone turnover, increases bone mineral density while decreasing parathyroid hormone
* Supplementation with vitamin D and Ca<small><sup>2+</sup></small> decreases bone loss and fracture rates in the elderly
* Bone turnover rates return to baseline when therapy discontinued
* Genetic polymorphism may determine response to therapy
  * _BB_ genotype of _Bsml_ vitamin D receptor associated with 2-fold increase in
  fracture risk
* Dark-skinned people and those with little exposure to sunlight may benefit most from supplementation
* Supplementation at 400 IU daily can benefit large portion of the population
* Addition of Ca<small><sup>2+</sup></small> may enhance benefit
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin C
### Coronary Heart Disease
* Antioxidant properties of vitamin C thought to play a role in CHD reduction
* Little evidence to suggest vitamin C alone reduces CHD
* Combination of vitamin E and vitamin C may provide benefit against CHD

### Cancer
* Moderately strong evidence suggesting inverse relationship between diets high in vitamin C and cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach and premenopausal breast cancer; particularly in women with positive family history
* Meta-analysis found 20% reduction in breast cancer risk associated with dietary vitamin C<small><sup>129</sup></small>
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin A
* Because of its effects on epithelium and immunity it has been investigated as a chemoprotective agent in cancer
* Vitamin A ma decrease the risk of bladder and breast cancer but the evidence is weak
* Gene-diet interactions and variation in retinol-binding protein are thought to influence response
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Vitamin K
Involved in the synthesis of clotting factors VII, IX, X and bone metabolisms

### Coagulation
* Because significant portion of vitamin K is synthesized by gut bacteria; patients taking antibiotics are at risk for bleeding (low vitamin K)
* Patients with malabsorption or hepatic disease are also at increased risk for hemorrhage
* Dietary variation can interfere with warfarin dosing
* Excessively anticoagulated patients can be given oral or parenteral vitamin K

### Fracture Risk
* Vitamin K is cofactors for &gamma;-carboxylation of glutamyl residues on osteocalcin
and other bone proteins.
* Lower bone mineral density, higher fracture rates have been reported in patients with low circulating vitamin K levels
* Women with low dietary vitamin K are at increased risk of hip fracture<small><sup>150, 151</sup></small>

# Recommendations

(_Fletcher RH, Fairfield KM_)
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Suboptimal vitamin levels
* High prevalence of suboptimal vitamin levels in the us suggests that US diet does not provide sufficient amounts of vitamins
* Recommended 5 daily servings of fruits and vegetables; survey suggests only 20-30% of population meets this goal
* Folate supplementation of cereal products only provides 100 &mu;g, well below the 400 &mu;g/d recommended daily intake
* Large portion of population has serum homocysteine levels from 1.62-2.03 mg/L which fall to 1.08-1.35 mg/L after a few weeks of folate, B<sub>12</sub>
* Elevated parathyroid hormone falls with vitamin D supplementation
* Supplementation with folate in patients with normal serum folate levels still corresponded reduction in serum homocysteine suggesting that serum vitamin levels should not be used to guide therapy

</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Correcting suboptimal levels
### Diet
* The first approach to correcting low vitamin levels is through improving diet
* This approach is difficult due to the individual counseling required as well as the difficulty associated with convincing patients to change their diet

### Fortified foods
* A second option is to add vitamins to generally consumed foods (i.e. folate to cereals, vitamin D to milk)
* This approach is limited by popular mistrust of adding chemicals to food

### Vitamin supplements
* Third option is for individuals to take vitamin supplements
* Contents of basic multivitamins are similar across brands
* Calcium content is typically between 40-160 mg; well below RDI of 1000-1500 mg/d
    * Multivitamin alone not sufficient
* Multivitamin containing iron may not be appropriate for non-menstruating women or men with the HFE C282Y or H63D polymorphism predisposing hemochromatosis
* Elderly pregnant women may require additional supplementation (B<sub>12, vitamin D and folate)

</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Testing
* Some individuals may have unusual vitamin needs based on their diets of genetic polymorphisms
* MTHFR polymorphism is associated with low folate levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and occurs in 5-15% of the population

</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Recommendations
* Recommend that all adults take one multivitamin daily due to the benefits of B<sub>12</sub>, B<sub>6</sub> and vitamin D in preventing cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis.
* May consider 2 doses of multivitamin in elderly due to increased requirement for B<sub>12</sub> and vitamin D
    * May be safer to give 1 multivitamin with additional B<sub>12</sub> and vitamin D to avoid fractures due to increased vitamin A and hemochromatosis from iron overload
* Generally the amount of folate in a single multivitamin is sufficient to supplement individuals with high EtOH intake
* For women attempting to conceive; an additionally 400 &mu;g/d of folate may be required to bring total folate intake to 800 &mu;g/d

</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Obtaining patient history
Providers should talk to their patients about vitamins with 2 goals in mind
* First, they should be sure that their patients know about the vitamin supplements they clearly should be taking (i.e. folate during childbearing years)
* Second, providers should make sure patients are not taking harmful doses of vitamins such as high doses of vitamin D or vitamin A during pregnancy.
