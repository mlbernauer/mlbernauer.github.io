# Background
* Atrial fibrillation responsible for &gt; 70,000 ischemic strokes each year<small>1</small>
* Anticoagulation reduces risk of ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation<small>2</small>
* Anticoagulation increases risk for developing bleed<small>3</small>
* GI tract is the most common site of bleeding due to oral anticoag treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation
* Up to 50.9% of patients with atrial fibrillation do not resume therapy after GI bleed<small>4</small>
* Little data exist on whether to restart antithrombotic treatment or withhold treatment after GI bleed<small>5</small>

# Methods
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Patient registries
* **Danish National Patient Registry**: information on hospital admission data.
    * Primary and secondary diagnoses
    * Procedures and surgical operations
* **Danish National Prescription Registry**: records all claimed drug prescriptions form pharmacies in Denmark
* **Danish Civil Registration System**: contains information about an individual's vital status and cause of death

## Study population
### Inclusion
* Atrial fibrillation
* Experienced GI bleeding while receiving vitamin K antagonist, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor.

### Exclusion
* Age &lt; 30 or Age &gt; 100
* Valvular heart disease
* Total hip or knee replacement surgery &le; 8 weeks before inclusion event
* DVT or PE &le; 6 months before inclusion event
* Death or thromboembolic event, major bleeding, recurrent GI bleed within 90 days after inclusion event
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Antithrombotic treatment

### Single oral anticoagulant (OAC)
* Vitamin K antagonist, dabigatran, rivaroxaban

### Single antiplatelet
* Aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor

### Dual or triple therapy<small>*</small>
* Oral anticoagulation, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor

_*The number of patients restarting on triple therapy was small and therefore excluded from analysis._
</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Concomitant medical treatment and comorbidities
### Concomitant medications
* Concomitant medications used during bleeding event were identified using prescription fill history during the 90 days leading up to the inclusion event.
* Concomitant medications used at baseline were determined using prescription fill history during the 90 day blanking period

### Comorbidities
* Stroke risk was assessed using CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores
    * CHF, HTN, Age &ge; 75, DM, Stroke or TIA (Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74, Sex[F])
* Bleeding risk was assessed using HAS-BLED scores
    * HTN, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, previous bleed, INR, age &ge; 65, drugs (antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs) or EtOH abuse.

## Outcomes and follow-up
### Outcomes
* All cause mortality
* Admission to hospital
* Death due to thromboembolism
    * Defined as ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic thromboembolism
* Major bleeding
    * Intracranial bleeding, severe bleeding from respiratory system, GI or urinary tract
* Recurrent GI bleeding
    * Defined using all diagnosis codes for GI bleeding

### Follow-up
* Follow up occurred until either of the outcomes: death, five year follow-up, or Dec 31, 2012, whichever came first.

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Statistical analysis
* Baseline characteristics were represented using means and standard deviations
* Independence/homogeneity was assessed using &chi;<small>2</small> tests
* Cumulative incidence of outcomes was assessed using the Aalen-Johansen method
* Time dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the risk of events during follow-up
* Significance was determined using two-sided &alpha; of &lt; 0.05

# Discussion
* Cumulative incidence of death was high (39.9%) within 2 years of inclusion event
* 27.1% of patients did not resume antithrombotic treatment after experiencing GI bleed
* Restarting treatment with single OAC was associated with lowest risk of all cause mortality and thromboembolism (HR 0.39 [0.34-0.46], 0.41 [0.31-0.54]) compared with non-resumption of therapy
* None of the treatments were associated with increased risk of recurrent GI bleed

## Strengths and limitations
### Strengths
* Nationwide cohort of 4,602 patients with atrial fibrillation
* Low bias: data observed independent of sex, age, socioeconomic status or participation in health insurance programs
* Danish national prescription registry allows assessment of concomitant medications
* Sensitivity and subgroup analyses support authors conclusions

### Limitations
* Study design does not allow determination of causality
* No way to directly assess or control for adherence
* Patients with inclusion events close to Dec 31, 2012 may not have had sufficient follow-up time to manifest outcomes
* 90-day blanking peroid excludes patients who may have died as the result of GI bleed after resumption of therapy
* Limitation of registries prevents assessment of INR, warfarin adherence, serum creatinine, renal function, hemoglobin and other potential confounders

# Conclusion
* Results support resumption of antithrombotic treatment after experiencing GI bleed
* Single OAC was associated with the largest reduction in all cause mortality/thromboembolism however also associated with an increase in major bleeding 
* Single antiplatelet therapy associated with reduction in all cause mortality and thromboembolism without increasing risk of major bleed
* None of the treatments were associated with an increased risk of recurrent GI bleed compared to non-resumption of therapy
