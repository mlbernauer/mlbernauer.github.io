## Antibiotic Weights

### Calculation
Each antibiotic $i$ is given a weight $w_i$, according to the number of organisms that are *susceptible* to that antibiotic.
Antibiotics with lower rates of resistance (higher susceptibility rate) are given higher weights. Weights can take on values $0 \le w_i \le 1$

$$w_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} S_{ij}$$

Where $n$ is the total number of species included in the scoring definition and $S_{ij}$ is the proportion of susceptible organisms for antibiotic $i$ and species $j$

$$S_{ij} = 1 - \frac{R_{ij}}{N_{j}}$$

$R_{ij}$ is the number of organisms of species $j$ that are resistant to antibiotic $i$ and $N_j$ is the total number 
of organism of species $j$ (both susceptible and resistant).

## Resistance Scores
### Calculation
The restance score, $Q_{k}$, is calculated for each organism $k$ and is the weighted sum of antibiotics that the
organism is resistant to and a can be expressed as

$$Q_{k} = w_{1}X_{1k} + w_{2}X_{2k} + ... + w_iX_{ik}$$

Where and $X_i \in \{0,1\}$ depending on whether the organisms is susceptible or resistant to antibiotic $i$. This can
be show more compactly as

$$Q_k = \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iX_{ik}$$

Where $n$ is the total number of antibiotics in the data set and $k$ is the total number of organisms in the data set.
