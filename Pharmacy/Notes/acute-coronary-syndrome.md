# Acute Coronary Syndrome

_Created by [Michael L. Bernauer](http://mlbernauer.com) on 2016-01-03_

### Classification

_Acute coronary syndromes_ include syndroms consistent with acute myocardia
which result from an imablance in myocardial oxygen demand and supply.

* ACS can be broken into two categories based on ECG changes
    * ST-segment-elevation:
        * STEMI
    * Non-ST-segment-elevation:
        * Non-STEMI
        * Unstable Angina

### Pathophysiology

* Endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and fatty streaks contribute to the formation of athersclerotic plaques.
* Ninety percent of ACS patients experience ruptured, fissured, erosion of plaques.
    * Plaque rupture &rarr; collagen/tissue factor exposed &rarr; ADP and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> released from platelets &rarr; more platelet activation &rarr; glycoprotein IIb/IIIa conformation change which facilitates fibrinogen cross-bridges &rarr; clotting.
* Blood exposed to thrombogenic lipid core (rich in tissue factor) results in simultaneous activation of extrinsic coagulation cascade resulting in fibrin clot (fibrin strands, cross-linked platelets, trapped RBCs)
* MI &rarr; ventricular remodeling &rarr; left ventricular dilation &rarr; reduced pumping function &rarr; cardiac failure
* MI complications:
    * Cardiogenic shock
    * HF
    * Valvular dysfunction
    * Arrhythmias
    * Pericarditis
    * Stroke secondary to left ventricular thrombus embolization
    * venous thromboembolism
    * LV free-wall rupture

## Clinical presentation
* Midline anterior chest discomfort at rest
* Sever new-onset angina or increasing angina lasting at least 20 minutes
    * May radiate to shoulder, down left arm, to back or jaw.
* Nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and SOB are also common
* ACS patients may have signs of acute HF or arrhythmias on physical exam

## Diagnosis
* Obtain 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes
    * MI findings include:
        * ST-segment-elevation, ST-segment-depression, inverted T-wave
        * Some MI patients have no ECG changes and thus biomarkers and other coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors should be assessed.
* Biomarkers are useful for confirming MI
    * MI confirmed by rise/fall of cardiac troponin
        * At least one reading &gt; 99 percentile of upper reference limit + one
        of the following:
            1. symptoms of ischemia
            2. new significant ST-changes
            3. pathological Q waves
            4. imaging showing loss of myocardium or abnormal wall movement.
    * Obtain blood sample once in ED then 6-9 hours later

### Treatment

#### Goals:
* Immediate goals
  1. **Restore blood flow** to infarcted tissue
  2. **Prevent death** and complications
  3. **Prevent reocclusion**
  4. **Relieve ischemic chest discomfort**
  5. **Restore to normal ST-segment, T-wave**
* Long term goals:
  1. **Control risk factors**
  2. **Prevent additional events**
  3. **Improve quality of life**

#### General approach
1. **Oxygen** if saturation &lt; 90%
2. **Stool softener** to prevent Valsalva maneuver
3. **Pain relief** and **bedrest**
4. **Obtain baseline labs**: K, Mg, glucose, creatinine, CBC, coagulation tests, and fasting
lipds
    * Lipids should be obtained with 24 hours of hopitalization; cholesterol is
    acute phase reactant and may be low after

* **STEMI** patients should undergo immediate **reperfusion and adjunct pharmacotherapy**

#### Nonpharmacologic
* **STEMI:**
    * If &lt; 12 hours from symptom onset **start PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact**
* **NSTEM ACS:**
    * **Coronary angiography** + (**PCI** OR **CABG**)

#### STEMI pharmacothearpy
* All STEMI patients should be receive the following in the ED
    1. **Oxygen** (if saturation is low)
    * **Sublinqual NTG **
    * **ASA**
    * **P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors** (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor)
    * Anticoagulation with **bivaliruden, UFH, enoxaparin**
* **If undergoing PCI** GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (**abiximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban**) + **UFH**
* **IV NTG** and **IV &beta;-blockers** should be given to select patients
* **Oral &beta; blockers** should be given on first day to patients without cardiogenic shock
* **Morphine** should be given if refractory angina to provide analgesic and vasodilatin (lower preload)
* Start **ACE** inhibitors within 24 hours in patients with **anterior wall MI** or **LVEF &le; 40%** and no contraindications

##### Fibrinolytic thearpy
* Given to **STEMI** + **&le; 12 hours FMC** + **unable to perform PCI with 120 min of FMC**
    * If &gt; 12 hours, only use if ongoing ischemia is present
* Do not need biomarker results to initiate
* **Contraindications (use PCI instead):**
    1. Hx of hemorrhagic Stroke
    * Ischemic stroke within 12 months
    * Internal bleeding
    * Intracranial neoplasm
    * Cerebrovascular lesion
    * Aortic dissection
    * Head/facial trauma within 3 months
* Fibrin specific agent preferred (**alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase**) over nonspecific agent (streptokinase)
* Administer fibrinolytics ASAP (ideally within 30 min of ED)
* **Alteplase**: 15 mg IV bolus + 0.75mg/kg (max 50mg) over 30 min &rarr; 0.5 mg/kg (max 35 mg) over 60 min (max 100 mg)
* **Reteplase**: 10U IV over 2 min &rarr; 10U IV over 2 min 30 minutes later
* **Tenecteplase**: Single IV bolus given over 5 seconds
    * &lt; 60 kg: 30 mg
    * 60-69.9 kg: 35 mg
    * 70-79.9 kg: 40 mg
    * 80-89.9 kg: 45 mg
    * &gt; 90 kg: 50 mg
* **Streptokinase**: 1.5 million U in 50ml NS (or D5W) IV over 60 minutes
* **Side Effects:**
    * **Intracranial hemorrhage** (ICH) and **major bleeding**
        * ICH risk: Alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase &gt; streptokinase
        * Systemic bleeding: streptokinase &gt; alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase

##### Aspirin
* All patients get ASA **within &pm; 24 hours of hospital**
    * Additional mortality benefit in STE ACS when given with fibrinolytics
* 160-325mg of **non-enteric coated** should be given a symptom onset or immediately at hospital
* 325mg if getting PCI and ASA note previously taken
* 75-162mg maintenance dose should be taken indefinately
* Low dose (81 mg) recommended with P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors after PCI
* DC all other NSAIDS and COX_2 inhibitors due to increased mortality

##### P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors
* **clopidogrel**, **prasugrel**, **ticagrelor** block the platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> ADP receptor
preventing binding of ADP and expression of GP IIb/IIIa receptors reducing platelet aggregation.
* **P2Y<sub>12</sub>** in addition to **ASA** is recommended in all STEMI cases. **P2Y<sub>12</sub>** + **ASA** in patients undergoing PCI to prevent stent thrombosis and CV events
* **P2Y<sub>12</sub>** inhibitors should be given for at least 12 months following PCI (bare metal or drug eluting stents)
* Withold **clopidogrel** and **ticagrelor** for 5 days prior to CABG and **prasugrel** for 7 days to reduce post-op bleeding
* **Clopidogrel**:
    * 300 mg loading dose + 75 mg daily in patients receiving fibrinolytics
    * No loading dose if &gt; 75 years old
    * 600 mg loading dose prior to PCI (300 mg if < 24 hours of fibrinolytics)
* **Prasugrel**: 60 mg LD + 10 mg daily for patients &ge; 60 kg.
* **Ticagrelor**: 180 mg LD in patients undergoing PCI + 90 mg BID
* **Side effects**:
    * Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
    * Rare thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with clopidogrel

* **STEMI + fibrinolytics**: Clopidogrel 300 mg LD + 75 mg daily x 28 days reduces mortality and risk of reinfarction without increased bleeding risk
    * No LD if patient &ge; 75 years old
* **STEMI w/o reperfusion therapy**: **Clopidogrel** + **ASA** x 14 days (up to 1 year)

##### GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors
