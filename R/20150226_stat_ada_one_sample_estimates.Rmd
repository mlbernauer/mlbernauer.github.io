## Learning objectives
1. Select graphical displays that meaningfully communicate properties of a sample.
2. Assess the assumptions of the one-sample t-test visually
3. Decide whether the mean of a population is different from a hypothesized value.
4. Recommend action based on a hypothesis test.

## Inference for a population mean


### Standard error, LLNN, and CLT
The **standard error (SE)** is the standard deviation of the **sampling distribution** of a statistic. The **sampling distribution** of a statistic is the distribution of that statistic, considered as a random variable, when derived from a random sample of size _n_.

The **standard error of the mean (SEM)** is the standard deviation of the sample-mean's estimate of a population mean.

```{r}
population <- runif(1000, 0, 1)
pop_mean <- mean(population)
