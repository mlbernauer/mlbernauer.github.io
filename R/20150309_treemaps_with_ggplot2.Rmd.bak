## Tutorial for generating treemaps with treemapify
This tutorial is adapted from the Treemapify [documentation](https://github.com/wilkox/treemapify).

## Dependencies and data
The Treemapify package depends on `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, `plyr` and must be installed with `devtools`

For any treemap, you need a data frame containing at least the following columns:
* A numeric column, which will determine the area of each treemap rectangle.
* Another numeric column, which will determine the fill color of each treemap rectangle.

For this example we'll use a couple of optional columns
* A factor column, containing labels for each rectangle (Country)
* A second factor column, containing labels for groups of rectangles (Region)

```{r}
require(devtools)
# Install treemapify if not already
if(!require(treemapify)){install_github("wilkox/treemapify")}

# Load G20 summit data
data(G20)
head(G20)
```

## Mapping the data to coordinates
The `treemapify` function generates coordinates for a treemap in which each observation
is represented as a rectangle. In this example, each observation is a country; the rectangle's
area will be mapped to the country's nominal GDP, while the fill color will be mapped to the Human
Development Index (HDI). We'll also group the contiries by region.

```{r}
# Generate coordinates for the rectangles
treemap_coords <- treemapify(G20, area="Nom.GDP.mil.USD", fill="HDI", label="Country", group="Region")
head(treemap_coords)
ggplotify(treemap_coords) + labs(title="G-20 GDP and HDI")
```

In the example above, the fill color is mapped to HDI which is continous, giving us a continous color gradient. If we were to map the color to 
another variable (discrete) we would get a discrete colormapping.

```{r}
treemap_coords <- treemapify(G20, area="Nom.GDP.mil.USD", fill="Economic.classification", group="Region", label="Country")
ggplotify(treemap_coords) + labs(title="G-20 GDP and Economic Classification")
```
