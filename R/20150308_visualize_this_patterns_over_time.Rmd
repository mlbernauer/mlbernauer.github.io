## Creating a Bar Graph
In this example we will create a bar graph to show results from the past three decades of Nathan's
Hot Dog Eating Contest.

## Read in the data
First we must read in the data. Lucky for us Nathan Yau has provided us with a nicely formatted database.
```{r}
hotdogs <- read.csv("http://datasets.flowingdata.com/hot-dog-contest-winners.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
head(hotdogs)
```

## Designing the plot using R-base graphics
We are interested in showing the number of HDBs eaten over time. To acheive this, we will plot the number of HDBs eaten
by the winner for each year.
```{r}
colors <- ifelse(hotdogs$New.record == 1, "darkred", "grey")
barplot(hotdogs$Dogs.eaten, names.arg = hotdogs$Year, col=colors, border=NA,
        main = "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1980-2010", 
        xlab="Year", ylab="Hot dogs and buns (HDBs) eaten")
```

## Designing the plot using ggplot2 graphics
Now let's try to create the same figure using `ggplot2`.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(hotdogs) + geom_bar(aes(x=Year, y=Dogs.eaten, fill=factor(New.record)), stat="identity") + 
  labs(title="Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1980-2010", fill="New Record") + xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Hot dogs and buns (HDBs) eaten")
```

## Stacked bar plot using R-base graphics
Instead of viewing the number of HDBs eaten by the top contestant for each year we can view the top three.
```{r}
# Read in the data, each row is a different contestant
hotdog_places <- read.csv("http://datasets.flowingdata.com/hot-dog-places.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
# Convert to matrix
hotdog_places <- as.matrix(hotdog_places)
# Rename the columns to correspond to the years 2000-2010
colnames(hotdog_places) <- lapply(2000:2010, as.character)
barplot(hotdog_places, border=NA, main="Hot Dog Eating Contest Results, 1980-2010", xlab="Year",
        ylab="Hot dogs and buns (HDBs) eaten")
```


## Results
Throughout the 1990s, the winners ate 10-20 hot dogs and buns (HDBs) in about 15 minutes. However, in 2001, Takeru Kobayashi, a
professional eater from Japan, obliterated the competition by eating 50 HDBs. That was more than twice the amount anyone in the
world had eaten before him.
